## 🚀 About Me

I am an AI/Data Scientist with a strong focus on building reliable, real-world machine learning systems that solve meaningful problems in healthcare and biomedical domains.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- Clinical data science
- Deep learning
- Federated learning (privacy-preserving AI)
- Large-scale, messy, real-world datasets

I enjoy designing **end-to-end ML pipelines** — from data cleaning and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment — with an emphasis on reproducibility, robustness, and real clinical impact.

Currently, my research explores **heterogeneous federated learning with stacking for multi-label ECG diagnosis**, enabling hospitals to collaboratively train models without sharing sensitive patient data.
